This is my solution to the [Dine Website Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dine-restaurant-website-yAt7Vvxt7) on Frontend Mentor. It's a fully responsive, multi-page restaurant website that includes tabbed content and a validated booking form.

Users should be able to:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) â€“ build tool

### What I learned

This challenge helped me practice responsive design and form validation in a real-world project. I also improved my understanding of handling tabbed content dynamically in React.

Hereâ€™s a small snippet of my validation logic:

```js
const validateEmail = (email) => {
  return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
};
```
